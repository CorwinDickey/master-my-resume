# Master My Resume  

Deployed at [Live Page](https://safe-spire-74741.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview  
This is the second project for my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course, and is my first full-stack CRUD application. The general purpose of the application is to provide a place for people to consolidate their resume and easily assemble different resumes to be submitted for different applications. It uses the concept of a "master resume" as its inspiration.
